                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Karmistha, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at Islington. My passion lies in becoming a front-end developer, and I find immense joy in crafting new projects.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    My journey into the world of web development started with a fascination for how websites work and look. I began tinkering with simple HTML and CSS, experimenting with different designs and layouts. 
                    As I delved deeper, I discovered the power of JavaScript in adding interactivity and functionality to web pages, and I was hooked.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    What excites me most about front-end development is the opportunity to blend creativity with technical skills. 
                    I love the challenge of translating a design concept into a fully functional website or application, ensuring that it not only looks great but also provides an intuitive user experience.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    In my quest to become a proficient front-end developer, I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies and frameworks. 
                    From mastering popular libraries like React and Vue.js to staying updated on the latest trends in responsive design and web accessibility, 
                    I'm dedicated to honing my skills and staying ahead of the curve.
