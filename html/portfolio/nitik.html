                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hey there! I'm a student currently enrolled in Islington, pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computing.
                    I've always been drawn to the world of computers ever since I got my hands on my first one.
                    There's just something about the endless possibilities they offer that excites me.One of my biggest
                    passions is coding.
                    I find it incredibly rewarding to write lines of code and see them come to life as functional
                    programs.
                    From simple scripts to more complex applications, I enjoy the challenge of making things work and
                    solving problems along the way.
                    Whether it's creating a game, building a website, or developing software to automate tasks, I'm
                    always eager to dive in and explore new coding languages and techniques.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But my love for computers doesn't stop at software. I'm equally fascinated by the hardware side of
                    things.
                    Learning about the components that make up a computer, how they interact with each other, and the
                    latest advancements in technology is like uncovering the secrets of a digital playground.
                    From processors and graphics cards to memory and storage devices, each component plays a vital role
                    in shaping the capabilities of a computer system.
                    Experimenting with different hardware configurations and understanding how they impact performance
                    is something I find both intriguing and satisfying.
